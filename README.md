# Mini Cooper Makes and Models

## Description

Create a dynamic one-page app for Mini Cooper based on class build. Click on one of the Mini models to show more content/data about the car moddels. Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX will be used to build this app. 
* Create an AJAX request for the mini data housed in the database using the Fetch API/XHTTP object. 
* XHTTP/Fetch function handle the stages of an AJAX request, and give some feedback if the request fails (use separate functions/handlers for each stage of an AJAX request).
* Handles failure first.
* Use components to render data. 
* When click on the cars, the associated data will show up.
